Mission3


In this Mission, take the API which is created, and build a DevOps pipeline to deploy it automatically.

Build a DevOps pipeline for API


Build a pipeline that deploys your API from Mission 1 or 2 to a cloud automatically. You need to build the pipeline using Github Actions so that as soon as you “git push” a new version of the code to your Github repository, the new code will automatically get deployed to Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud, and your new version of API is available on the cloud. Also automate the running of unit tests as part of the pipeline.
